    "'''MongoDB is an open-source documnet-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows \n",
    "you to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage\n",
    "and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most databases can be categorized as either relational or non-relational. Non-relational databases are sometimes\n",
    "referred to as 'NoSQL', which stands for Not only SQL. The main difference between these is how they store their \n",
    "information. A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the\n",
    "traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures. It does not follow the relational model provided by traditional\n",
    "relational database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents. A document can be highly detailed while \n",
    "containing a range of differnent types of information in different formats. This ability to digest and organize \n",
    "various types of information side by side makes non-relational databases more flexible than relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is iften preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where flexible schema design, scalability, and handling\n",
    "large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Unstructured data:- MongoDB excels when dealing with data that does not fit neatly into tables with fixed schems,\n",
    "making it suitable for applications with evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Scalability:- MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities make it well-suited for applications that require seamless\n",
    "scaling across distributed systems and clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Agile Development:- Projects that involve iterative development and frequent changes benefit from MongoDB's flexible \n",
    "schema, allowing developers to modify the data model without significant disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Real-time Analytics:- MongoDB can handle real-time analytics as well, making it suitable for applications where\n",
    "real-time data insights are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Document-oriented data:- If your data is inherently document-oriented or hierarchical, MongoDB's document-based\n",
    "model can be more intuitive.'''"

    "'''1)Document model:-\n",
    "Data is stored as documents and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is a lot more natural for \n",
    "developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects. This means that developers\n",
    "can focus on the data they need to store and process, rather then worrying about how to split the data across different\n",
    "rigid tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documents in a single collection need don't necessarily need to have exactly the same set of fields. This is what\n",
    "we call a 'flexible schema'. This flexibility allows developers to iterate faster and migrate data between different\n",
    "schemas without any downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents in MongoDB are stored in the BSON format, which is a binary-encoded JSON format. This means that the data is\n",
    "stored in a binary format, which is much faster than JSON. This also allows for the storage of binary data, which is\n",
    "useful for storing images, videos and other binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Sharding:- \n",
    "Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or 'shards'. When aplied \n",
    "to particularly in large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise\n",
    "be problematic and cumbersome queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding in MongoDB allows for much greater horizontal scalability. Horizontal scaling means that each shard in every \n",
    "cluster houses a portion of the dataset in question, essentially functioning as a seperate database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Replication:-\n",
    "When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as as \n",
    "server crash, service interruptions, or even good harware failure. Any of these events would make accessing your data\n",
    "nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and\n",
    "backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Authentication:-\n",
    "Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. It ensures that only authorized users can access the\n",
    "database. MongoDB provides a number of authentication mechanisms for users to access the database.\n",
