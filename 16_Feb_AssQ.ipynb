    "'''The order of execution of SQL Query optimizes the query, reduces the amount of data to be processed, and affects\n",
    "the performance of the Query processing significantly. The order makes the SQL engine process the queries faster,\n",
    "and efficiently, and obtains optimized query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)First, the table on which the DML operation is performed has to be processed. So, the FROM clause evaluated first in\n",
    "an SQL Query. If the query contains JOIN clauses, tables are combined by merging rows involved, before FROM clause.\n",
    "So, JOIN predates FROM in statements with JOIN. Now table is aquired before any filter is done. \n",
    "\n",
    "2)WHERE: After the table data on which other operations take place is processed by JOIN and FROM clause, WHERE clause\n",
    "is evaluated. WHERE clause filters the rows based on conditions from the table evaluated by the FROM clause. This \n",
    "WHERE clause discards rows that don't satisfy the conditions, thus reducing the rows of data that need to be processed\n",
    "further in other clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)GROUP BY: If the query has the GROUP BY clause, it is executed next. Here, the data is grouped based on the common\n",
    "value in the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. This reduces the number of rows further equal to no of distinct\n",
    "values in the GROUP BY column. This helps to calculate aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)HAVING: If the query had a GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause is evaluated immediately after GROUP BY. HAVING clause\n",
    "is not compulsory for GROUP BY. Similar the WHERE operations, this clause also filters the table group processed before\n",
    "by the GROUP BY clause. This HAVING also discards the rows that don't satisfy the conditions, thus reducing the rows of\n",
    "data that need to be processed in other clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)SELECT: The SELECT is executed next after GROUP BY and HAVING. It computes expressions (arithmetic, aggregate, etc)\n",
    "and aliases given in the SELECT clause. The computation is now performed on the smallest dataset after much filtering\n",
    "and grouping operations done by previous clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)DISTINCT: The DISTINCT clause is executed after evaluating expressions, and alias references in the previous step.\n",
    "It filters any duplicate rows and returns only unique rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)ORDER BY: After executing all the above clauses, the data to be displayed or processed is computed. Now ORDER BY is\n",
    "executed to sort it based on particular column(s) either in ascending or descending order. It is left associative\n",
    ", that is it is sorted based on the first specified column and then by the second and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)LIMIT/OFFSET: At last, after the order of data to be processed is evaluated, LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are evaluated\n",
    "to display only the rows that fall within the LIMIT. So, it is generally not recommended to LIMIT only certain rows\n",
