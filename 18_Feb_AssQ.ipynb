    "'''Advantages:-\n",
    "Increased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless\n",
    "their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange \n",
    "of data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software\n",
    "systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better User Experience: APIs can enable thirty-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing\n",
    "software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming\n",
    "languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing thirdy-party developers with\n",
    "access to their software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:-\n",
    "Security Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and \n",
    "cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or\n",
    "between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the\n",
    "software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and \n",
